* DESCRIPTION: This code declares an ASP.NET web page class named Certifications which is
* of inherited type System.Web.UI.Page allowing it to function as web page in the 
* Application_1 namespace. The `Page_Load` method is fired up whenever the page is loaded
* or refreshed or reloaded again. And now the `Page_Load` actually does nothing – it does
* not do anything when the page is loaded in the browser. Usually, this method is used to
* set controls on application start or to set content on the page
